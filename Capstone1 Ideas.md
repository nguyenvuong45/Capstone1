* *Capstone Project 1 Ideas*

**Recipe Recommendation System**
What’s in your fridge? What are your options for what you’ve got? Whether it’s a quick bite to eat or a recipe for counting calories, this recommendation system will use the recipe dataset from Epicurious (https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes) to find different options given ingredients and possibly type of food. Macronutrients info in this dataset could also be used to track progress towards caloric goals. 

**Life Expectancy**

The Life expectancy dataset provides info on life expectancy and various contributing factors for all countries. These factors range from basic categorization of status (developing/ developed countries), to immunization and mortality statistics. Data are provided for each country from the year 2000 - 2015 which can be used to predict life expectancy going forward. This project will also aim to answer questions of how various countries can optimize their effort to increase life expectancy. 

**Predicting Badminton Scores**
Using officially broadcasted videos of badminton matches on Youtube to extract data in shot selection and positioning to analyze and predict score line/ winner of each rally. This would possibly be based on player behavior given factors like positioning after certain shot choice and opponent response. The goal is also to aid in analysis of playstyle for developing effective strategies.
